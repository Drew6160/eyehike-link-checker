# 🏔️ Eyehike Webcam Link Checker

Automatically checks every webcam link on [eyehike.com/2016/webcams/](https://www.eyehike.com/2016/webcams/) and generates a report showing which links are working, broken, or redirected.

Runs automatically on GitHub — no server or local machine needed.

## 📋 What it checks

Every external link on the webcams page (~130+ links), categorized as:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| ✅ OK | Link is working |
| ↪️ Redirect | Link works but points to a new URL — worth updating |
| ❌ Broken | HTTP error (404, 403, 500, etc.) — link is dead |
| ⏱️ Timeout | Server didn't respond — may be temporarily down |
| ⚠️ Error | DNS failure or SSL error |
